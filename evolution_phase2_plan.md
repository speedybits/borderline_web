# Evolution Phase 2: Red Counter-Evolution Plan

## Current Status
- **Generations Completed**: 1-21
- **Blue Strategy**: LOCKED at Gen 13-20 parameters (Defensive Blocker)
- **Red Strategy**: Evolving to counter Blue's blocking
- **Target**: Red achieves 90%+ win rate

## Phase 1 Summary (Generations 1-20)

### Key Milestones
- **Gen 0**: Baseline (Red 2, Blue 1) - 66.7% Red
- **Gen 1-2**: Peak diversity (12-13 decisive games)
- **Gen 11**: Blue's breakthrough with blocking strategy (Blue 4, Red 3)
- **Gen 17**: Blue dominates (Blue 4, Red 0!) with blocking
- **Gen 18-19**: Strategies converge (ties)
- **Gen 20**: Final balanced state (Red 1, Blue 0)

### Blue's Winning Formula (Locked)
The "Defensive Blocker" strategy:
- **Center control**: Bonus for columns 1-4
- **Critical rows**: Huge bonus for rows 3-4 (Red's bottleneck)
- **Combat aggressive**: Seeks fights (28 pts)
- **Balanced vertical**: Moderate progress (50 pts/row)

## Phase 2 Strategy (Generations 21-40)

### Red's Evolution Path

**Gen 21: Extreme Edge Runner**
- Vertical: 80 pts/row
- Edges only: +60 for cols 0,5; -30 for center
- Result: 50% win rate (4-4) - NOT ENOUGH

**Planned Evolutions** (if win rate < 90%):

**Gen 22-25: Refinements**
- Increase vertical urgency (85-90 pts)
- Add row-skipping logic (jump over middle)
- Maximize combat power (18-20 pts/pip)

**Gen 26-30: Adaptive Tactics**
- Multi-column approach (use edges 0,5 AND 1,4)
- Tempo control (block Blue's expansion)
- Sacrifice strategy (lose battles to gain converted pieces)

**Gen 31-35: Advanced Techniques**
- Piece rotation optimization
- Defensive positioning in Red's rows (0-2)
- Counter-blocking (place where Blue wants to go)

**Gen 36-40: Final Optimization**
- Fine-tune all parameters
- Exploit any remaining weaknesses
- Achieve 90%+ target

## Success Criteria

Achieve **90% or higher win rate** in decisive games:
- Example: Red 9, Blue 1 = 90%
- Example: Red 10, Blue 1 = 91%
- Example: Red 18, Blue 2 = 90%

## Insights from Evolution So Far

1. **Sweet Spot Effect**: Over-optimization backfires (Gen 2 > Gen 10)
2. **Counter-strategies work**: Blue's blocking beat Red's aggression
3. **Adaptation is key**: Red must avoid Blue's strengths
4. **Combat matters**: High pip counts win fights
5. **Column strategy**: Critical for avoiding blocks

## Expected Challenges

- Blue's blocking may be too strong (90% might be impossible)
- Edge-only strategy may create predictable patterns
- Need creativity beyond parameter tuning
- May require fundamental strategy shift

## Backup Plans

If 90% proves impossible after 40 generations:
1. Try completely different Red strategies (diagonal, sacrifice, etc.)
2. Consider that Blue's blocker might be near-optimal defense
3. Analyze if 8-row victory condition favors defense over offense
4. Document that perfect counter-strategy may not exist
