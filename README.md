# Borderline

A strategic board game with AI opponents and a stunning TRON-inspired GUI.

## Overview

- **Human vs Human**: Two players on the same device
- **Human vs AI**: Play against intelligent AI opponents
- **AI vs AI**: Watch AI strategies battle each other

python3 borderline_gpt.py --human_vs_ai
```
You play as Blue, AI plays as Red.

**AI vs Random**:
```bash
python3 borderline_gpt.py --blue_random
```
Watch Red AI demolish random Blue moves.

### GUI Mode (TRON Edition)

## Game Rules

### Board
- 8 columns Ã— 6 rows grid
- Red starts at bottom row (row 0)
- Blue starts at top row (row 5)

### Pieces
- Each player has 16 pieces
- Each piece is a 3Ã—3 grid of pips
- Pieces can have 1-9 pips active
- Piece power = number of active pips

### Placement
- Pieces must connect to existing pieces (or home row for first move)
- Connection can be orthogonal or diagonal (corner-to-corner only)
- No overlap allowed

### Combat
- Occurs when pieces are adjacent after placement
- Both players roll 1d6
- Higher roll wins (attacker wins ties)
- Losing piece is converted to winner's color

### Victory
- Create a contiguous path of pips from your home row to opponent's home row
- Path must be connected orthogonally (up/down/left/right)

### Draw Conditions
- Both players run out of pieces
- Both players have no valid moves (stalemate)
- Turn limit reached (10,000 turns)

## Development

### Strategy Development
AI strategies are defined in the `AIPlayer.evaluate_move()` method in `borderline_gpt.py`.

Key evaluation factors:
- **Forward Progress**: Distance toward opponent's home row
- **Connection Strength**: Number of pips connected to existing pieces
- **Path Continuity**: Maintaining contiguous vertical paths
- **Battle Opportunity**: Strategic combat positioning
- **Piece Efficiency**: Managing remaining pieces

### Testing Strategies
```bash
python3 optimize_vs_random.py
```

Runs 100-game benchmark of current strategy against random opponent.

### GUI Customization
Edit CSS files in `static/css/`:
- `main.css`: Layout and structure
- `tron.css`: Colors, glows, and animations

Color palette defined in `tron.css`:
```css
--bg-black: #0a0a0a
--grid-line: #1a1a2e
--red-neon: #ff0055
--blue-neon: #00d4ff
--green-accent: #00ff88
--amber: #ffaa00
```

## Performance

### Strategy Win Rates (vs Random, 100 games)
- **Aggressive (GEN 30)**: 71% overall, 95.9% decisive
- Average game length: 234 turns
- Draw rate: 26% (legitimate stalemates)

### GUI Performance
- 60 FPS canvas rendering
- <50ms real-time update latency
- Supports concurrent games via Socket.IO
