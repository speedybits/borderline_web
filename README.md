# Borderline

A strategic board game with AI opponents and a stunning TRON-inspired GUI.

## Overview

Borderline is a two-player strategy game played on an 8Ã—6 grid where players place 3Ã—3 pip pieces to create a contiguous path from their home row to the opponent's home row. Features combat mechanics with dice rolls and multiple AI strategies.

## Features

### Game Modes
- **Human vs Human**: Two players on the same device
- **Human vs AI**: Play against intelligent AI opponents
- **AI vs AI**: Watch AI strategies battle each other
- **Random Player**: Test strategies against random moves

### AI Strategies
- **Aggressive**: Forward-pushing offensive strategy (71% win rate vs random)
- **Defensive**: Territory control and blocking
- **Random**: Completely random legal moves

### Graphics Modes
- **ASCII Terminal**: Classic command-line interface
- **TRON GUI**: Web-based graphical interface with glowing neon aesthetics

## Installation

### Requirements
```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio python-socketio
```

No additional dependencies required for terminal mode.

## Usage

### Terminal Mode (ASCII)

**AI vs AI (default)**:
```bash
python3 borderline_gpt.py
```

**Human vs AI**:
```bash
python3 borderline_gpt.py --human_vs_ai
```
You play as Blue, AI plays as Red.

**AI vs Random**:
```bash
python3 borderline_gpt.py --blue_random
```
Watch Red AI demolish random Blue moves.

### GUI Mode (TRON Edition)

```bash
python3 borderline_gpt.py --gui
```

Then open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

**GUI Features**:
- Neon red (#ff0055) and cyan (#00d4ff) glowing pieces
- Semi-reflective black background
- Animated dice rolling with 3D tumbling
- Power levels displayed on pieces
- Turn indicator with pulsing glow
- Victory screen with animations
- Real-time game updates via Socket.IO
- Mouse-based piece placement
- Combat log with color-coded messages

**Supported Browsers**:
- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Game Rules

### Board
- 8 columns Ã— 6 rows grid
- Red starts at bottom row (row 0)
- Blue starts at top row (row 5)

### Pieces
- Each player has 16 pieces
- Each piece is a 3Ã—3 grid of pips
- Pieces can have 1-9 pips active
- Piece power = number of active pips

### Placement
- Pieces must connect to existing pieces (or home row for first move)
- Connection can be orthogonal or diagonal (corner-to-corner only)
- No overlap allowed

### Combat
- Occurs when pieces are adjacent after placement
- Both players roll 1d6
- Higher roll wins (attacker wins ties)
- Losing piece is converted to winner's color

### Victory
- Create a contiguous path of pips from your home row to opponent's home row
- Path must be connected orthogonally (up/down/left/right)

### Draw Conditions
- Both players run out of pieces
- Both players have no valid moves (stalemate)
- Turn limit reached (10,000 turns)

## API & Extensibility

Borderline features a comprehensive **chess-engine-style JSON API** that separates game logic from presentation. This enables multiple frontends, AI development, replay systems, and dynamic piece management.

### Core API

**12 API Methods:**
- `execute_move()` - Execute moves via standard JSON format
- `get_game_state()` - Get complete game state
- `get_valid_moves()` - Query all legal moves (for AI development)
- `export_game()` / `replay_game()` - Save and replay games
- `get_move_history()` - Access complete move history
- **Piece Management** (6 methods) - Add, remove, create custom pieces dynamically

### Quick Start

```python
from borderline_gpt import BorderlineGPT

# Create game
game = BorderlineGPT()

# Play a turn
move = {
    "player": "R",
    "piece_index": 0,
    "position": [0, 3],
    "rotation": 0
}

result = game.execute_move(move)
if result['valid']:
    print("Move executed!")
    for event in result['events']:
        print(f"Event: {event['type']}")

# Save game
game.export_game("my_game.json")
```

### API Benefits

- âœ… **Multiple Frontends** - Web, CLI, desktop, mobile all use same engine
- âœ… **AI Development** - Standard interface for creating AI engines
- âœ… **Replay System** - Games saved as human-readable JSON
- âœ… **Dynamic Pieces** - Add/remove/create pieces during gameplay
- âœ… **Extensibility** - Easy to add new piece types and game modes

### Documentation

- **API.md** - Complete API reference (920 lines)
- **API_SUMMARY.md** - Quick reference with examples
- **api_example.py** - Working demonstrations
- **piece_management_example.py** - Advanced use cases
- **test_complete_api.py** - Comprehensive test suite

### Example Use Cases

**Create AI Player:**
```python
game = BorderlineGPT()
while not game.game_over:
    valid_moves = game.get_valid_moves()
    move = my_ai_choose_best(valid_moves)
    result = game.execute_move(move)
```

**Gift Pieces (Game Modes):**
```python
# Gift random piece every 5 turns
if turn % 5 == 0:
    result = game.gift_random_piece(current_player)
```

**Custom Pieces:**
```python
# Create super piece
result = game.create_custom_piece('R', [
    [0,0], [0,1], [0,2],
    [1,0], [1,1], [1,2],
    [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]
])  # 9-pip block
```

## Development

### Strategy Development
AI strategies are defined in the `AIPlayer.evaluate_move()` method in `borderline_gpt.py`.

Key evaluation factors:
- **Forward Progress**: Distance toward opponent's home row
- **Connection Strength**: Number of pips connected to existing pieces
- **Path Continuity**: Maintaining contiguous vertical paths
- **Battle Opportunity**: Strategic combat positioning
- **Piece Efficiency**: Managing remaining pieces

### Testing Strategies
```bash
python3 optimize_vs_random.py
```

Runs 100-game benchmark of current strategy against random opponent.

### GUI Customization
Edit CSS files in `static/css/`:
- `main.css`: Layout and structure
- `tron.css`: Colors, glows, and animations

Color palette defined in `tron.css`:
```css
--bg-black: #0a0a0a
--grid-line: #1a1a2e
--red-neon: #ff0055
--blue-neon: #00d4ff
--green-accent: #00ff88
--amber: #ffaa00
```

## Performance

### Strategy Win Rates (vs Random, 100 games)
- **Aggressive (GEN 30)**: 71% overall, 95.9% decisive
- Average game length: 234 turns
- Draw rate: 26% (legitimate stalemates)

### GUI Performance
- 60 FPS canvas rendering
- <50ms real-time update latency
- Supports concurrent games via Socket.IO
