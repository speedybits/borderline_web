## Results by Generation

### Phase 1: Discovery (Gen 0-10)

| Gen | Red Wins | Blue Wins | Draws | Decisive | Red Win % | Notes |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | 2 | 1 | 97 | 3 | 66.7% | Baseline |
| 1 | 8 | 4 | 88 | 12 | 66.7% | Peak diversity |
| 2 | 11 | 2 | 87 | 13 | **84.6%** | Sweet spot! |
| 3 | 9 | 3 | 88 | 12 | 75.0% | - |
| 10 | 5 | 2 | 93 | 7 | 71.4% | Over-optimized |

**Key Finding**: Gen 2 (moderate optimization) outperformed Gen 10 (extreme optimization) - the "Sweet Spot Effect"

---

### Phase 2: Blue's Breakthrough (Gen 11-20)

| Gen | Red Wins | Blue Wins | Draws | Decisive | Red Win % | Blue Strategy |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 11 | 3 | **4** | 93 | 7 | 42.9% | Blocking discovered! |
| 12 | 4 | 3 | 93 | 7 | 57.1% | Red adapts |
| 17 | **0** | **4** | 96 | 4 | 0% | Blue dominates! |
| 20 | 1 | 0 | 99 | 1 | 100% | Convergence |

**Blue's Winning Formula** (Gen 13-20):
- Center blocking (cols 1-4): +35 pts
- Critical row control (rows 3-4): +40 pts
- High combat: 28 pts
- Philosophy: "Block Red's path through the middle"

---

### Phase 3: Red's Counter-Evolution (Gen 21-24)

**Goal**: Achieve 90%+ win rate against locked Blue strategy

| Gen | Red Wins | Blue Wins | Draws | Decisive | Red Win % | Red Strategy |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 21 | 4 | 4 | 92 | 8 | 50% | Extreme edge runner |
| 22 | **5** | 2 | 93 | 7 | **71%** | Best result! |
| 23 | 3 | 3 | 94 | 6 | 50% | Row-skipping failed |
| 24 | 2 | 3 | 95 | 5 | 40% | Over-optimization |

**Best Red Strategy** (Gen 22):
- Edges (0, 5): +60 pts
- Vertical progress: 80 pts
- Combat: 30 pts
- Philosophy: "Avoid Blue's center, build on edges"

**Conclusion**: 90% target impossible against Blue's blocking. Gen 22's 71% appears to be the ceiling.

---

### Phase 4: Competitive Balance (Gen 25)

| Gen | Red Wins | Blue Wins | Draws | Decisive | Red Win % | Evolution |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 25 | 3 | 2 | 95 | 5 | 60% | Both strategies unlocked |

**Blue's New Strategy** (Gen 25 - Edge Contester):
- Shifted to contest edges (cols 0, 5): +50 pts
- Increased combat: 38 pts
- Increased vertical: 65 pts
- Philosophy: "Fight Red on their turf!"

**Result**: Red's win rate dropped from 71% to 60% - competitive balance restored!

---

## Major Discoveries

### 1. The Sweet Spot Effect

**Finding**: There exists an optimal parameter range - excessive optimization reduces performance.

**Evidence**:
```
Gen 2 (moderate):    13 decisive games, 84.6% Red win rate
Gen 10 (optimized):   7 decisive games, 71.4% Red win rate

Gen 22 (balanced):    7 decisive games, 71% Red win rate
Gen 24 (ultra-high):  5 decisive games, 40% Red win rate
```

**Explanation**: Over-optimization creates predictable, exploitable patterns. Moderate aggression maintains adaptability and unpredictability.

---

### 2. Counter-Strategies Emerge Naturally

**Timeline**:
1. **Gen 0-10**: Red's aggression dominates (66-85%)
2. **Gen 11**: Blue discovers blocking strategy
3. **Gen 17**: Blue completely dominates (4-0)
4. **Gen 22**: Red counters with edge strategy (71%)
5. **Gen 25**: Blue counters with edge contesting (60%)

**Lesson**: Evolutionary arms races create dynamic, balanced gameplay.

---

### 3. The 8-Row Victory Challenge

**Finding**: Victory is rare across all generations (87-97% draws)

**Why Victory is Hard**:
- 8-row span requirement is demanding
- Both strategies effectively block each other
- Piece exhaustion causes draws
- Random piece generation adds variance
- Combat dice rolls introduce luck

**Implication**: Game design is well-balanced - skill matters but luck plays a role.

---

### 4. Limits of Single-Strategy Optimization

**Phase 3 Results** (Red vs locked Blue):
- 4 generations of attempts
- Best result: 71% (Gen 22)
- 90% target: Never achieved
- Multiple approaches tried: edges, row-skipping, ultra-speed

**Conclusion**: Against a strong defensive strategy, even optimal offense has limits. True improvement requires both sides to adapt.

---

## Optimal Strategy Parameters

### Red's Best (Gen 22 - 71% vs Blue's blocker)

```python
Vertical progress: 80 pts/row
Vertical connection: 40x multiplier
Combat engagement: 30 pts/enemy
Pip power: 15 pts/pip
Edge columns (0, 5): +60 pts
Near edges (1, 4): +20 pts
Center penalty: -30 pts
Distance from center: +15 pts/unit
```

**Philosophy**: "Fast vertical progression on edges, avoiding Blue's center blocking"

---

### Blue's Classic Blocker (Gen 13-20 - 60% vs Red's aggression)

```python
Vertical progress: 50 pts/row
Vertical connection: 25x multiplier
Center blocking (cols 1-4): +35 pts
Critical rows (3-4): +40 pts
Adjacent rows (2, 5): +20 pts
Combat seeking: 28 pts/enemy
Territory control: 22 pts
Pip power: 11 pts/pip
```

**Philosophy**: "Control the center and middle rows, disrupt Red's vertical progress"

---

### Blue's Edge Contester (Gen 25 - 40% vs Red's edges)

```python
Vertical progress: 65 pts/row (increased!)
Vertical connection: 35x multiplier
Edge columns (0, 5): +50 pts (NEW!)
Near edges (1, 4): +25 pts
Center (reduced priority): +10 pts
Combat seeking: 38 pts/enemy (huge increase!)
Pip power: 14 pts/pip
```

**Philosophy**: "Contest Red on edges with superior combat power"

---

## Strategic Insights

### What Works

1. **Vertical Progress**: 55-85 pts optimal range
2. **Vertical Connection**: 25-45x multiplier
3. **Moderate Combat**: 18-40 pts (depends on strategy)
4. **Column Strategy**: Edge focus (0, 5) or center control (1-4)
5. **Incremental Evolution**: Small tweaks compound over time

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Extreme Optimization**: Pushing parameters to 95-100 backfires
2. **Pure Defense**: Territory control alone fails
3. **Row Penalties**: Trying to "skip" rows breaks connectivity
4. **Radical Pivots**: Often worse than refinement
5. **Single Metric Focus**: Need balanced approach

---

## Game Balance Analysis

### Draw Rate Evolution

```
Gen 0-3:   87-97% draws (avg 91%)
Gen 10:    93% draws
Gen 11-20: 93-99% draws (avg 95%)
Gen 21-25: 92-95% draws (avg 94%)
```

**Conclusion**: Draw rate remains consistently high (87-99%) regardless of strategy evolution. This indicates:
- Victory condition is appropriately difficult
- Game favors neither offense nor defense inherently
- Skill and luck both matter
- Well-balanced design

### Competitive Balance

**Most Balanced Matchups**:
- Gen 1: Red 8, Blue 4 (66.7%)
- Gen 11: Red 3, Blue 4 (42.9% - Blue wins!)
- Gen 25: Red 3, Blue 2 (60%)

**Least Balanced**:
- Gen 17: Red 0, Blue 4 (0% - Blue dominates)
- Gen 2: Red 11, Blue 2 (84.6% - Red dominates)

**Average Across All Gens**: Red wins ~60% of decisive games

## Lessons for Game Design

### 1. Emergent Complexity

Simple scoring parameters (vertical progress, combat, territory) created complex strategic depth through evolution. Players discovered:
- Edge running vs center control
- Blocking strategies
- Combat prioritization
- Connection optimization

### 2. Balance Through Evolution

Instead of pre-balancing, letting strategies evolve competitively achieved balance naturally:
- Gen 0-10: Red dominance
- Gen 11-20: Blue rises
- Gen 21-24: Red adapts
- Gen 25: Balance restored

### 3. The Role of Randomness

High draw rates (87-99%) despite optimized strategies show:
- Random piece generation prevents perfect play
- Combat dice add excitement
- Skill is necessary but not sufficient
- Replayability remains high
