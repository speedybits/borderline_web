# Borderline GPT Evolution Summary

## Complete Evolution Timeline (Generations 0-25)

### Phase 1: Initial Evolution (Gen 0-10)
**Goal**: Discover effective strategies through competitive evolution

- **Gen 0**: Baseline (Red 2, Blue 1) - 66.7% Red
- **Gen 1-2**: Peak diversity (12-13 decisive games) - **Sweet Spot discovered!**
- **Gen 10**: Over-optimized (7 decisive games) - Proof that more isn't always better

**Key Discovery**: The "Sweet Spot Effect" - moderate optimization (Gen 2) beats extreme optimization (Gen 10)

---

### Phase 2: Blue's Blocking Era (Gen 11-20)
**Goal**: Blue finds counter-strategy to Red's aggression

- **Gen 11**: Blue discovers blocking strategy - WINS 57% (4-3)
- **Gen 13-20**: Blue refines blocking - dominates center and middle rows
- **Gen 17**: Blue's peak (4-0 shutout!)
- **Gen 20**: Strategies converge (Red 1, Blue 0)

**Blue's Winning Formula**: Defensive Blocker
- Center control (cols 1-4): +35 pts
- Critical rows (3-4): +40 pts
- High combat (28 pts) to disrupt

---

### Phase 3: Red's Counter-Evolution (Gen 21-24)
**Goal**: Red achieves 90%+ win rate against locked Blue strategy

**Attempts**:
- **Gen 21**: Extreme edge runner (50% - Red 4, Blue 4)
- **Gen 22**: Same strategy (71% - Red 5, Blue 2) ✓ BEST RESULT
- **Gen 23**: Multi-path with row-skipping (50% - Red 3, Blue 3) ❌ FAILED
- **Gen 24**: Ultra speed sprint (40% - Red 2, Blue 3) ❌ REGRESSION

**Key Learnings**:
1. Row penalties don't work - breaks connectivity
2. Over-optimization backfires (Gen 24 worse than Gen 22)
3. 90% target likely impossible against Blue's blocking
4. 71% is solid but hitting a ceiling

**Decision**: Abandon 90% goal, resume competitive co-evolution

---

### Phase 4: Competitive Co-Evolution Resumes (Gen 25+)
**Goal**: Both strategies evolve together for dynamic gameplay

**Gen 25 - Current**:
- **Red**: Refined edge runner (small tweaks to Gen 22's 71% formula)
- **Blue**: MAJOR PIVOT - Edge contester!
  - Abandons center blocking
  - Contests Red on edges (cols 0, 5)
  - Massive combat increase (38 pts) to win edge battles

**Strategy**: Return to what worked in Gen 1-20 - let both sides adapt!

## Statistical Summary

| Phase | Gens | Decisive Games (avg) | Red Win % (avg) | Strategy Diversity |
|-------|------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 0-10 | 3-13 (high variance) | 66-85% | High - exploring |
| Phase 2 | 11-20 | 4-7 | 43-57% (Blue rises!) | Medium - converging |
| Phase 3 | 21-24 | 5-7 | 40-71% | Low - Red locked on edges |
| Phase 4 | 25+ | TBD | TBD | High - both evolving! |

## Key Insights

### 1. Sweet Spot Effect
**Finding**: There's an optimal parameter range - too much optimization reduces performance

**Evidence**:
- Gen 2 (moderate params) → 13 decisive games, 84.6% Red
- Gen 10 (optimized params) → 7 decisive games, 71.4% Red
- Gen 22 (balanced edge) → 71% Red
- Gen 24 (ultra-aggressive) → 40% Red

**Lesson**: Balance beats extremes!

---

### 2. Counter-Strategies Work
**Finding**: A well-designed counter can flip the game

**Evidence**:
- Red dominated Gen 0-10 with aggression (66-85%)
- Blue's blocking reversed it in Gen 11-20
- Red's edge strategy countered Blue's blocking (71%)
- Blue now contests edges to counter Red

**Lesson**: Adaptation is key to long-term success!

---

### 3. The 8-Row Victory Challenge
**Finding**: Victory is rare - most games end in draws (87-97%)

**Why**:
- 8-row span is difficult to achieve
- Both strategies effectively block each other
- Piece exhaustion occurs before breakthrough
- Random piece generation plays a role

**Implication**: Well-balanced game design - skill matters but luck plays a role

---

### 4. Evolutionary Arms Race
**Finding**: Competitive co-evolution creates the most interesting gameplay

**Evidence**:
- Phase 1 (Gen 1-2): Most decisive games (12-13)
- Phase 2 (Gen 11-17): Dynamic shifts in power
- Phase 3 (Gen 21-24): Stagnation when Blue locked
- Phase 4 (Gen 25+): Excitement returns!

**Lesson**: Static opponents are boring - evolution needs competition!

## Best Strategies So Far

### Red's Best: Gen 22 (71% win rate)
- Vertical: 80 pts
- Connection: 40x
- Combat: 30 pts
- Edges (0, 5): +60 pts
- Philosophy: "Avoid Blue's center, build on edges"

### Blue's Classic: Gen 13-20 Blocker (60% vs Red's old aggression)
- Center blocking: +35 pts (cols 1-4)
- Row control: +40 pts (rows 3-4)
- Combat: 28 pts
- Philosophy: "Block Red's path through the middle"

### Blue's New: Gen 25 Edge Contester (TBD)
- Edges: +50 pts (contest Red!)
- Vertical: 65 pts (match Red's speed)
- Combat: 38 pts (win the edge battles!)
- Philosophy: "Fight Red on their turf!"

## What's Next?

1. See if Blue's edge-contesting works (Gen 25 results)
2. Continue co-evolution for 5-10 more generations
3. Track emergence of new strategies
4. Document the evolutionary arms race
5. Create final comprehensive report

**Prediction**: We'll see oscillating dominance as strategies counter each other - that's the beauty of evolution!
